- Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mitchel, I am currently 25 years old and my hometown is Utrecht (The Netherlands). In my spare time I am involved in Front-end and Back-end development, I like to experiment with new functions related to development. I also do some craftwork in Photoshop and Illustrator. In addition, I am currently studying Software Development.
